Create a metacommunity

\details{
The metacommunity describes the possible biological space for a \code{flume} model. It
consists of a few named elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{species}: a list of \code{\link[=species]{species()}} objects, describing the niche and dispersal parameters
for each possible species
\item \code{competition}: A square species interaction matrix describing the effect of each species
on each other species; generated using the overlap between species'
\href{f_niche.species()}{fundamental niches}.
\item \code{boundary}: A function that returns a site by species matrix giving the colonisation flux
from outside the river network; by default returns zero for all sites/species.
}

The \code{comp_scale} is treated as a multiplier, changing the value of the competition matrix.
By default the \code{comp_scale} parameter is 1/nsp, meaning pairwise competition gets less important
with the number of species (but overall competition may still increase, because pairwise
interactions are summed). This parameter must be:
\itemize{
\item a single value, interpreted as the overall strength of competition in the metacommunity,
\item a vector of length \code{nsp}, interpreted as the competitive strength of each species, or
\item a matrix with \code{nsp} rows and \code{nsp} columns, if asymmetric competition or fine control over
the strength of each interaction is desired. For asymmetric competition, changing the value of
\code{comp_scale[i,j]} will change the effect of species \code{i} on species \code{j}, but not the other way
around.
}

Each species' fundamental niche is defined as the difference between a Gaussian colonisation
function and a constant extinction function; a species will be present when c - e > 0.
Niches can be automatically generated (see \code{\link[=generate_niches]{generate_niches()}}; alternatively, to specify
the parameters manually, the following can be specified.
